# Project: End-to-End ML Pipeline for Churn Prediction

This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using telecom data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, experiment tracking, and deployment as a FastAPI web service.

---

## üìä Dataset
- Source: Telco Customer Churn (e.g., Kaggle)
- Goal: Predict whether a customer will churn based on service and demographic attributes

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Data preprocessing with `ColumnTransformer`
- RandomForest classifier pipeline
- MLflow logging of metrics and models
- Trained model served with FastAPI

---

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model
```bash
python src/main.py -c configs/example_random_forest.yaml
```

### 3. Run the API
```bash
uvicorn api.app:app --reload
```

### 4. Access the API Docs
Go to: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
